## Introduction

<img width="283" alt="BigBirds User Flow" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/k62QMcVWi3nX3vP9y1/giphy.gif">

This project is for the new birders of Colorado who are overwhelmed by field guides and options. If you're just starting, you're not worried about the difference between a sanderling and semipalmated sandpiper anyways.

This app provides a top 30 species list of your area. When you see one, check it off! Click to view details about these birds, too. You will see an accumulated list of viewed birds & when you checked them off. As you gain confidence in your identification stills, the more birds you'll check off and soon, you'll take flight into more advanced options such as [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/), and the [Audubon's Society's](https://www.audubon.org/) apps.

Originally, this project was built for a project with Turing School of Software & Design. [See rubric here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

## Future Iterations

I would like to ensure a proper link is created for the "Guess this Bird". I feel as if it would improve user experience if they could click this bird and view the details.

Additional look at SAD path testing and stubbing of the API calls should be applied.

The biggest refactoring would be surrounding creating an additional backend for user data to be posted rather than relying on localStorage as I temporarily have.

More specifics about future work or refactoring can be found in this projects [GH issues](https://github.com/gaj23/bigbirds/issues).
