## Introduction

This project is for the new birders of the mid-west who are overwhelmed by field guides and options. If you're just starting, you're not worried about the difference between a sanderling and semipalmated sandpiper anyways.

This app provides a top 100 species list of your area. When you see one, check it off! Click to view details about these birds, too. You will see an accumulated list of viewed birds & when you checked them off. As you gain confidence in your identification stills, the more birds you'll check off and soon, you'll take flight into more advanced options such as eBird, Merlin, and the Audubon's Society's apps.

Check back later to see when the recent, notable sightings tab is ready for viewing.

Originally, this project was built for a project with Turing School of Software & Design. [See rubric here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

- clone this repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:gaj23/rancid.git <renameHere>`
- API documentation & endpoints are [here](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/)
  - Due to low rate limit of our chosen API you may choose to use the `Data` folder contained inside or our [server](https://github.com/kelsiebesingeryeh/face-it-server)
  - To use the local server in you CLI: `git clone git@github.com:kelsiebesingeryeh/face-it-server.git <renameHere>`
  - `cd <nameOfServer>`
  - `npm init --yes`
  - `npm i express --save`
  - `node server.js`
- from there please create a new branch following this pattern: `git checkout -b initials/feature-fix/focus-of-branch`
- cd into your local copy and run `npm install`
- Use Cypress for testing
 - check that the following key-value pair in `scripts` is in your `package.json`
 - `"cypress": "cypress open"`
 - if not please download Cypress with `npm i -D cypress` and add the above to `scripts`.
- contribute as you'd like and push up your work for review
Thank you.
